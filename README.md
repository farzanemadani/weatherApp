## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank [Net Ninja] for creating an amazing course on how to create a weather app with Vue 3, TailwindCSS, and OpenWeather API. The course taught me the basics of Vue 3, such as components, props, slots, directives, and reactive data. It also showed me how to use TailwindCSS to style the app and how to fetch data from the OpenWeather API using axios. I learned a lot from this course and I enjoyed making the weather app. You can find the course and the source code in the links below:
